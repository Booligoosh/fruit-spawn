# Fruit Spawn
Fruit Spawn is a Chrome extension that spawns a bunch of fruit emojis on websites you visit when you click the button.

Credit goes to [/u/346pm](https://www.reddit.com/user/346pm) and their post [I am the best webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7f9812/i_am_the_best_webdev/) on Reddit.

I based this off their code, but modified and improved upon it in many ways, and turned it into a Chrome extension!
